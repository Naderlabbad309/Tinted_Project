Player_Exective and Additional Exective folder are codes that inherit from MonoBehaviour and can be attache to Gameobject or Player.
Player_Exective and Additional Exective folder codes mostly have interface IPlayerable Which mean they are player and they have health they can be damage etc. 
PlayerSysteam folder have Gameinteract code that have two clases PlayerSystem and AISystem and mostly Exective code inherit from them.
TecCode have codes like a Ray to start ray from Gameobject left and right and check if the ray hit wall or etc.. 
PlayerSysteam use TecCode and struct.

:) Thanks
